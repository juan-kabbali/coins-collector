In this simple game, you have to collect all coins before time runs out.

You can configure:
* Player’s force, this affects the movement’s speed.
* Maximum time of the game, when it reaches 0, the game is over.
* Number of “coins” that scene has, the project automatically recognizes
how many coins there are, and configure the number of coins that the
player has to collect to win.
* You can add more coins as simple as dragging in the scene the prefab
called “coin”, or remove it from the scene, anyway the project will
recognize the number of coins.
